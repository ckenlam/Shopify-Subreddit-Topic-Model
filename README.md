I work for a company which develops conversational Interactive Voice Response (IVR) which enables human-like interactions allowing individuals to self-serve and successfully resolve issues within the IVR. We all know that's not always the case - things change and issues become more complex.

To anticipate customers' ever-changing needs for one of our clients, we have recently implemented an open-ended survey within the IVR to gather data on how the IVR failed to resolve their issues. The survey was conducted for two week and generated a sample of 2000 utterances. I then applied Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), a topic modeling algorithm, to identify the underlying themes in the collected survey responses and were able to make practical recommendations to our client.

Having gone through such exercise, **I want to conduct a similar experiment with reddit's data to uncover common topics that Shopify merchants/users submit to reddit**.
